About this software
===================

## cl-js 1.0.0

v1 of CL-js is the first version written in TypeScript. The TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScripts and is available at &lt;https://feeds.library.caltech.edu/modules/&gt;.

Legacy JavaScript, while still available in the &quot;scripts&quot; directory, is depricated. This includes the fomer &quot;ui&quot; JavaScript includes. Moving foward the UI elements are being developed in the [CL-web-components](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/CL-web-components) project. These will become available on &lt;https://feeds.library.caltech.edu&gt; at somepoint in the future.

With this release of CL-js both evergreen browsers and JavaScript/TypeScript runtimes are targeted. Development takes place using Deno 2 and testing is done using Firefox.
