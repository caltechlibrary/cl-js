  "releaseNotes": "v1 of CL-js is the first version written in TypeScript. The TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScripts and is available at <https://feeds.library.caltech.edu/modules/>.\n\nLegacy JavaScript, while still available in the \"scripts\" directory, is depricated. This includes the fomer \"ui\" JavaScript includes. Moving foward the UI elements are being developed in the [CL-web-components](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/CL-web-components) project. These will become available on <https://feeds.library.caltech.edu> at somepoint in the future.\n\nWith this release of CL-js both evergreen browsers and JavaScript/TypeScript runtimes are targeted. Development takes place using Deno 2 and testing is done using Firefox."
